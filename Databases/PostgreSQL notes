#### Key commands:
# Start postgres
lunchy stop postgres
# Stop postgres
lunchy start postgres

# Check if Postgres running
ps auxwww | grep postgres
# Then look for something like
# /usr/local/opt/postgresql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres -r /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log

# Create databases (two dbs here, syntax is owner/encoding/db_name)
createdb -Opostgres -Eutf8 testdb_development
createdb -Opostgres -Eutf8 testdb_test

# Log in to one of these dbs through the command line
psql -U postgres testdb_development



##### When homebrew finished, it gave me this:
	To have launchd start postgresql at login:
	    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
	Then to load postgresql now:
	    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
	Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
	    postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres

	==> /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.2/bin/initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf
	==> Summary
	üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.2: 2924 files, 40M

##### Or the next time I did it:
502 yasha.podeswa:~$ brew install postgres

Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/postgresql-9.3.2.mountain_lion.bottle.tar.gz
==> Pouring postgresql-9.3.2.mountain_lion.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
If builds of PostgreSQL 9 are failing and you have version 8.x installed,
you may need to remove the previous version first. See:
  https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/issue/2510

To migrate existing data from a previous major version (pre-9.3) of PostgreSQL, see:
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/upgrading.html

When installing the postgres gem, including ARCHFLAGS is recommended:
  ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg

To install gems without sudo, see the Homebrew wiki.

To reload postgresql after an upgrade:
    launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist

Other notes:

1) If this is your first install, create a db with:
initdb /usr/local/var/postgres
(creates a db "cluster", stored where noted above)

2) To have launchd start postgresql at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load postgresql now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist

3) How to make it really easy to start and stop postgres
sudo gem install lunchy

Now we can:
lunchy stop postgres
lunchy start postgres

Then I created a postgres user using the following steps:
http://www.maclife.com/article/columns/terminal_101_creating_new_users

And I can check out all users with:
dscacheutil -q user | grep -A 3 -B 2 -e uid:\ 5'[0-9][0-9]'

4) Now we can create a db owned by this user (postgres):
createdb -Opostgres -Eutf8 testdb_development
createdb -Opostgres -Eutf8 testdb_test
#					owner			encoding	db name

5) Now to access the db through the command line:
psql -U postgres testdb_development
#			users				database to connect to

Type:
help
To get help

6) Now I'm just following along through the postgres documentation
