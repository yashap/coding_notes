C* = Cassandra

Data Stacks
	- the guys presenting
	- provide platform/support around Cassandra db
		- C*
		- Analytics (Hadoop)
		- Search (Solr)
		- Interfaces for db (Eclipse, browser interface, etc.)
		- Support team
	- Basically, they're like Oracle, but focus on Cassandra

Why C*?
	- supposedly scales more easily than RDBMS
	- high uptime
	- dynamic
		- good at handling spikes?

Multi-node architecture
	- data comes in
	- can distribute writes
		- can also set replication factors
			- i.e. every write also means another 0, 1, 2, etc. backup writes
			- this is for backups, OR push reads to a less busy node
			- for most applications, RF = 3 is common
		- so, key value gets hashed, write directed to one node based on hash value, then write also replicated once the node is chosen
			- key values hashed with murmur3 hasing algo
	- if you have an RF of 3, that means every node will basically have 3 hashed key ranges it will accept
		- so the 3 copies of your data will be on 3 different nodes
		- each node essentially has 3 shrds
		- there's also no master copy of the data, there's 3 equal copies
