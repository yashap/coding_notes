Terminal shortcuts:

cd						Same as cd ~
opt + arrow		Skip word
ctrl + a			Home
ctrl + e			End
ctrl + u			Delete all before cursor
ctrl + k			Delete all after cursor
ctrl + w			Delete word after cursor
ctrl + y			Undo delete
ctrl + c			Cancel current command
ctrl + r			Search for comands containing search string
!!						Variable representing last command you ran
!<command>		Example: !git will re-run the last git command you ran
!<command>:p	As above, but just shows the command, doesn't run it
								You can then run it with !!
!$						New command with same argument as last command
								i.e.
									mkdir /new/awesome/folder
									cd !$


Other terminal hacks:

Drag file in
	Add path to file to current command

Tab while cd-ing
	If uncomplete path, will complete
	Else will list possible completions (basically like ls)

Expansions:
	Say you have a command with 2 arguments that are ALMOST the same
	For example, you want to rename the file extension:
		Normal way:
			mv /path/to/file.txt /path/to/file.xml
		Faster:
			mv /path/to/file.{txt,xml}

history				Print all commands
	history | grep <search term>
		i.e. history | grep cd
			Then to run a specific command from history, look at the numbers and
			!<number>
				i.e. !516 to run command 516

^<typo>^<correct command>
							If you have a typo in the command, so it fails, you can fix it
								i.e.
									eccho "Hello"
									<fails>
									^eccho^echo
