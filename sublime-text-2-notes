	CMD-P, then @
	Fuzzy search through methods, classes, etc.
		Can also combine sneakily with CMD-P
			i.e. CMD-P, type "styles"
			Get a bunch of hits for styles, but the top is styles.css
			Then type @body, so in total CMD-P, styles@body
			This will take you right to the CSS for the body in styles.css!

# Package Control

# New snippets
	Tools -> New snippet
		Brings up some XML where you can code your own snippet
		Save with the extension .sublime-snippet in the user folder
			Good to organize them by syntax too, i.e. put them in a JavaScript folder for JavaScript snippets, then they'll only show up with JavaScript syntax
